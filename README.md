# `cmn_ai`

**A practical toolkit to accelerate your AI, Deep Learning, and Data Science workflows.**

`cmn_ai` is a Python library born from extensive, real-world experience in building and training machine learning models. It's designed to handle the most common and repetitive tasks in an ML/AI project, from data exploration to model deployment.

This library is built on the principle of **Boyd's Law**: _speed of iteration beats quality of iteration_. By providing robust, reusable components, `cmn_ai` helps you move faster, experiment more, and deliver results sooner.

## Key Features ðŸš€

- **Accelerated Workflow**: Stop rewriting boilerplate code. `cmn_ai` provides ready-to-use modules for data preprocessing, model development, and training.
- **Best Practices Baked-In**: Benefit from years of experience. The library incorporates proven software engineering and machine learning best practices so you can build high-quality models with confidence.
- **PyTorch & Scikit-Learn Integration**: The deep learning modules, including the flexible `Learner` and callbacks, are built for **PyTorch**. The tabular data tools are fully compatible with **scikit-learn's** `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`.
- **Continuously Evolving**: The field of AI/ML moves fast, and so does `cmn_ai`. The library is actively maintained and updated with new functionalities.
