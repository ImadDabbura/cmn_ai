"""
Core callback system for training loop management.

This module provides the foundational callback system that allows for
custom behavior injection into machine learning training loops. It defines
the base `Callback` class and a set of control flow exceptions that
enable fine-grained control over the training process.

Classes
-------
Callback
    Base class for all callbacks, providing the interface for training
    loop integration and utility methods for callback management.
CancelFitException
    Exception to stop training and move to after_fit phase.
CancelEpochException
    Exception to stop current epoch and move to after_epoch phase.
CancelTrainException
    Exception to stop training phase and move to after_train phase.
CancelValidateException
    Exception to stop validation phase and move to after_validate phase.
CancelBatchException
    Exception to stop current batch and move to after_batch phase.
CancelStepException
    Exception to skip optimizer step and move to after_step phase.
CancelBackwardException
    Exception to skip backward pass and move to after_backward phase.

Notes
-----
The callback system works by defining specific event names that correspond
to different phases of the training loop. Callbacks can implement methods
with these event names to be called at the appropriate times:

- `before_fit`: Called before training begins
- `after_fit`: Called after training completes
- `before_epoch`: Called before each epoch
- `after_epoch`: Called after each epoch
- `before_train`: Called before training phase of each epoch
- `after_train`: Called after training phase of each epoch
- `before_validate`: Called before validation phase of each epoch
- `after_validate`: Called after validation phase of each epoch
- `before_batch`: Called before processing each batch
- `after_batch`: Called after processing each batch
- `before_step`: Called before optimizer step
- `after_step`: Called after optimizer step
- `before_backward`: Called before backward pass
- `after_backward`: Called after backward pass

Examples
--------
Creating a custom callback:

>>> class MyCallback(Callback):
...     def before_epoch(self):
...         print(f"Starting epoch {self.epoch}")
...
...     def after_batch(self):
...         if self.loss > 0.5:
...             raise CancelEpochException("Loss too high")

Using control flow exceptions:

>>> class EarlyStoppingCallback(Callback):
...     def after_epoch(self):
...         if self.epoch > 10 and self.valid_loss > self.best_loss:
...             raise CancelFitException("Early stopping triggered")

class Callback:
    """
    Base class for all callbacks.

    A callback is a mechanism to inject custom behavior into the training
    loop at specific points. Callbacks can be used for logging, early
    stopping, learning rate scheduling, and other custom functionality.

    Attributes
    ----------
    order : int
        The order in which callbacks should be executed. Lower numbers
        are executed first. Default is 0.
    learner : Any
        Reference to the learner object, set by `set_learner()`.

    Notes
    -----
    Subclasses should implement specific callback methods that correspond
    to training events (e.g., `before_fit`, `after_epoch`, etc.).
    """

    order: int = 0

    def set_learner(self, learner: Any) -> None:
        """
        Set the learner as an attribute so that callbacks can access
        learner's attributes without the need to pass `learner` for
        every single method in every callback.

        Parameters
        ----------
        learner : Any
            Learner that the callback will be called when some events
            happens. This object will be stored as `self.learner`.
        """

    def __getattr__(self, k: str) -> Any:

        Allow access to learner attributes directly through the callback.

        This would allow us to use `self.obj` instead of
        `self.learner.obj` when we know `obj` is in learner because it
        will only be called when `getattribute` returns `AttributeError`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        k : str
            The attribute name to access from the learner.

        Returns
        -------
        Any
            The attribute value from the learner object.

        ------
        AttributeError
            If the attribute is not found in the learner object.
